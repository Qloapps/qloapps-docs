
# Start Creating A Module

To understand the module in QloApps let's create a module.
We take the name of the module as **myqlomodule**.
Let us do this step-by-step process.

- In the first step, create a module folder. The folder's name must be the same as the name of the module and in lowercase in the /modules folder.

Note: *only alphanumerical characters, the hyphen, and the underscore, all in lowercase: /myqlomodule.*

- In the module folder, Create module main PHP file with the same name as the module folder's name: **myqlomodule.php** This main file handles most of the processing of the module..

*To create a basic module the above steps are enough. More files and folders are added as per the requirements.*

**Let's walk through the module's main file's contents. PHP file code must be started with the below code -**

#### First check the QloApps version constant.
This constant is always present. It is not defined then exit the module and do not load the module. 
**This prevents malicious users to load this file directly.**

```php
<?php
if (!defined('_PS_VERSION_')) {
  exit;
}
```

#### Create the module's Main Class.
The main file has a class with a name the same as the module's folder name but in the CamelCase letters. This class will extend any class derived from the Module class. for example, PaymentModule, ModuleGridEngine, ModuleGraph, etc classes are extended for specific needs.

myqlomodule.php
```php
<?php
if (!defined('_PS_VERSION_')) {
  exit;
}

class MyQloModule extends Module
{
}
```

*So this is the minimum requirement to show your module in the module list. Now if you put your module in the /modules folder then in the back-office modules list, this module will be seen in the "Other Modules" section.*

#### Create constructor method of the class

In object-oriented programming, the constructor method  is called when an object is created of a class.
In QloApps this method is called first whenever a module is loaded.
So we can put most of the details of the module in this method.

```php
<?php
if (!defined('_PS_VERSION_')) {
  exit;
}

class MyQloModule extends Module
{
  public function __construct()
  {
    $this->name = 'myqlomodule';
    $this->version = '1.0.0';
    $this->author = 'Module Author Name';
    $this->ps_versions_compliancy = array('min' => '1.6', 'max' => _PS_VERSION_);
    $this->bootstrap = true;
    $this->need_instance = 0;
    $this->tab = 'front_office_features';

    parent::__construct();

    $this->displayName = $this->l('Module display name.');
    $this->description = $this->l('Module description here.');

    $this->confirmUninstall = $this->l('Are you sure you want to uninstall?');
  }
}
```
Let us explain things used in the constructor method line by line.

These parameters are minimum for the constructor method. You can add more necessary parameters later if needed. So this is all about constructor method in the main class.


You will see the module in the module list. You can install the module by clicking the install button of the module.
click the "Proceed with installation" to proceed with installation.

#### **install() method of class**
You may need to perform some actions in the process of installation. In this case you can change the default install method of Module class and override it in your module's main class.

To override the install method below is the minimum code required -

```php
public function install()
{
	if (!parent::install()) {
		return false;
	}
	return true;
}
```
So above is the minimum code you need to write for the install method.
We call the super class `install()` method. It returns true on successful installation and false if there is some problem occurred in the installation.

**Now we will perform our actions on installation process like creating our database tables or entering data in the configuration table in the install process**

Lets perform below tasks
- Register hooks which we will use in the module
- Create and save value in the Configuration table (MYQLOMODULE_NAME).
- Create database tables of the module

```php
public function install()
{
  if (!parent::install() 
    || !$this->registerHook('actionFrontControllerSetMedia') 
    || !$this->registerHook('displayLeftColumn') 
    || !Configuration::updateValue('MYQLOMODULE_NAME', 'Module name in configuration table') 
    || !$this->createModuleTables()
  ) {
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```
If any action fails then installation process stops with error message.


#### **uninstall() method of class**

To perform your actions while uninstalling the module, you can change the default `uninstall()` method of Module class and override it in our module's main class.

To override the `uninstall()` method below is the minimum code required -
```php
public function uninstall()
{
	if (!parent::uninstall()) {
		return false;
	}
	return true;
}
```

Now while uninstallation process, Lets perform below tasks -
- Delete value in the Configuration table (MYQLOMODULE_NAME).
- Delete database tables of the module

```php
public function uninstall()
{
	if (!parent::install() ||
		!Configuration::deleteByName('MYQLOMODULE_NAME')
		!$this->dropModuleTables()
	) {
		return false;
	}
	return true;
}
```
If any action fails then uninstall process stops with error message.

#### **Configuration Class**
This class is used to store settings in the **PREFIX_configuration** table. You can store data in the table without creating tables in your module.

#### **The Main methods of Configuration Class**

- **`Configuration::get('myQloVariable')`** : Get a specific value through the name from "PREFIX_configuration" table.
- **`Configuration::getMultiple(array('firstQloVariable', 'secontQloVariable', 'thirdQloVariable'))`** : Get the multiple values in the form of array.
- **`Configuration::updateValue('myQloVariable', $customValue)`** : Update the value with the custom value in the "PREFIX_configuration" table.
- **`Configuration::deleteByName('myQloVariable')`** : Deletes the row from "PREFIX_configuration" table which have name "myQloVariable".

#### **Saving an array value. Store the array value by serializeing this first.**
```php
Configuration::updateValue('QLO_GLOBAL_SETTINGS', serialize(array('A', 'B', 'C')));
```

#### Get an array from the "PREFIX_configuration" table
```php
$arrayValue = unserialize(Configuration::get('QLO_GLOBAL_SETTINGS'));
```

#### Retrieving values from "PREFIX_configuration" table

There are many values you can get from "PREFIX_configuration" table. Below are some examples, How you can get the values-
- **`Configuration::get('PS_TIMEZONE')`** : Get the name of the default timezone.
- **`Configuration::get('PS_LANG_DEFAULT')`** : Get the Id of the default QloApps language.
- **`Configuration::get('PS_CURRENCY_DEFAULT')`** : Get the Id of the default QloApps Currency.

*So in many situations, you can use this "PREFIX_configuration" table with Configuration Class.*
*Explore "PREFIX_configuration" table for many other settings*


#### Icon Files
- There are two icon files in the module. It gives the finishing to any module development.
 - **logo.png**  : This file has size 32 x 32. This icon will be displayed besides the display name of the module in the backoffice module list.
 - **logo.gif**  : This file has size 16 x 16. This file used to represent the module in the backoffice.

You have to put this file in the root folder of the module. Modules's logo brings trust to your module for the users.

*Please make sure not to use the random logo for the module without the premission/authorization from any logo/service*

#### config.xml file
- A configuration file **config.xml** is automatically generated while module installation automatically. Be careful while editing this file.


**In the PREFIX_module table, A row is added for the module while module installation. This table contains installed modules information.**

This is how you can create a basic module. Try to develop a basic module and install it on QloApps.
