# Cookies

To save all the session information QloApps uses encrypted cookies. Cookies are saved for visitors/customers as well as for employees/administrators.

`Cookie` class is used for all the read and write operations.

Within QloApps code you can access cookies through cookie object in context object-

```php
$this->context->cookie;
```

- To get all the data of the cookie you can get it by cookie's name using the below code -

```php
$this->context->cookie->variable;
```

- In case you want to use a cookie from non QloApps codes you have to include some files and you can access cookies using the below code -

```php
// include belo files
include_once('QloApps_path/config/config.inc.php');
include_once('QloApps_path/config/settings.inc.php');
include_once('QloApps_path/classes/Cookie.php');

$cookie = new Cookie('ps'); 

// For employee's cookie Use "psAdmin".
$cookie = new Cookie('psAdmin');
```
