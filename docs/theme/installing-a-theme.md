# Installing a Theme
After successfully creating a theme and exporting it as a zip file it is time now to install it and confirm if everything works as expected.

QloApps provides three methods of importing a theme. We are going to discuss each one in detail.

What method to choose depends on your accessibility of the theme zip file.

To install a theme follow the steps below:

1. Go to **Preferences** > **Themes**.
2. Click on **Add new theme** at the top right of the page.
3. You will be presented with three options to choose from as shown below:
