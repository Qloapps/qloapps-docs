# QloApps architecture

QloApps is built by following the traditional object-oriented PHP practices. It is based on a custom framework.

The custom framework is developed on [3-tier architecture.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitier_architecture#Three-tier_architecture)

- **Object/data**. The files in the "classes" folder control the access of databases.

- **Data control**. Files in the root folder control User-generated content.

- **Design**. The "themes" folder contains the entirety of the theme's files are in.

This is the same as the MVC architecture but it is simpler and more accessible.
